# Welcome to Hangman

    The classic word-guessing game where your objective is to guess a hidden word, letter by letter, before the hangman is completely drawn. Below are the rules and guidelines to help you get started:

# Objective

    Your goal is to guess a word by suggesting letters within a certain number of guesses.

# Gameplay

Starting the Game:
To begin, choose a difficulty level: Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced, or Expert. The difficulty level determines the length of the word you need to guess.
Click on the 'Play' button to start the game.

Choosing Letters:
You will see a set of alphabet buttons on the screen. Each button represents a letter.
Select a letter by clicking on the corresponding button. This counts as a guess.

Correct Guesses:
If the chosen letter is in the word, it will be revealed in its correct position(s) in the word.
Letters can be used only once. After a letter is guessed, it becomes disabled.

Wrong Guesses:
If the chosen letter is not in the word, it counts as a wrong guess.
Each wrong guess brings you closer to completing the hangman drawing, which signifies game over.

Winning the Game:
To win, you must guess all the letters in the word before the hangman is fully drawn.
Successfully guessing the entire word without completing the hangman drawing results in a win.

Losing the Game:
The game is lost if the hangman is completely drawn before you can guess the word.
You will be given a limited number of guesses, which varies based on the difficulty level.

End of the Game:
At the end of the game, whether you win or lose, you can choose to play again by selecting a difficulty level and clicking on the 'Play' button.

# How to run the game on your machone.

### `npm install to install the dependancies`

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
